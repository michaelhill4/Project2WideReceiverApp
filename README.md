# Fast Food Randomizer

Hungry and not sure what you want to eat? Use our app to help cut down that decision making time. Simply create an account and then you can use our randomizer. Our randomizer allows you to choose between a small, medium, or large meal based on number of calories. Then you will be randomly selected from a group of popular chain restaurants what you should order.
